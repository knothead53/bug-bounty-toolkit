- Main domain: `{{ scope.main_domain }}`
{% if scope.in_scope %}
- Additional in-scope:
{% for d in scope.in_scope %}  - `{{ d }}`  
{% endfor %}

## Passive: crt.sh subdomains ({{ scope.passive.crtsh_subdomains | length }})

{% if scope.passive.crtsh_subdomains %}
Subdomains discovered via certificate transparency (crt.sh):
{% for sd in scope.passive.crtsh_subdomains %}
- `{{ sd }}`
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No crt.sh subdomains found.
{% endif %}

## Notes / Next steps (manual)
1. Validate the live hosts (HTTP/HTTPS) with `httpx` or `curl` (manual or safe automation).
2. For hosts in-scope, run non-invasive service enumeration (nmap -sV --version-light) with permission.
3. Import findings into Burp Suite for manual inspection and active testing (only with explicit permission).
4. Keep a strict timeline of every action including command used, date/time, and who authorized the test.
